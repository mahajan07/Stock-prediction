# Stock-prediction (FAAMNG)
### This repository contains my detailed analysis of investment and finance-related data science projects.
### These projects are written and presented as Jupyter Notebooks (Python 3), and each link is followed by a short description of project goals, contributions, and dependencies used.

# Projects
## Stock price Prediction for Top American Stocks- FAANMG

1. Performs complete comparisons of competitive strategy, financial strength, growth potential, and valuation of two companies through fundamental and technical analysis.
2. Wrote data parser and reader to download 10-Q and 10-K SEC filings and store them in pandas DataFrame, as well as scripts to append certain business performance metrics for trend analysis.
3. Designed risk-analysis models using Monte-Carlo Simulations and implemented visualizations using matplotlib and Seaborn.
4. Combined data with experts' opinions and shareholder sentiment on business strategy and comapny/management direction to make final "best buy" decision.

## Risk/Return Analysis and Predictions for 'FAAMNG' Stocks

1. Here I used pandas Dataframe to represent adjusted closing prices and compute moving averages, daily returns, and associated risk of 'FAANG' tech companies.
2. Created visual representations of comparative daily returns and single-stock analysis using Matplotlib, as well as more complex heatmaps and distribution plots using Seaborn.
3. Compared and plotted risk of investment between simple return analysis techniques and Monte-Carlo simulations.
